## Introduction

The end of the course is near and it is time for you to show your self-sustainability as a Data Scientist. Over the duration of the course you have been given instruction to help you understand, implement and pursue a wide range of data analytics and science concepts.  It has come time for you to leave the nest and explore something deeply on your own.

The choice of topics is completely up to you, but it must be approved by your local instructor.  This is an opportunity to more deeply research a topic of your interest (or may be something that you anticipate your capstone project will rely on), and commit to understanding it to a level where you can explain/demonstrate it to an interviewer (and the class!).

The purpose of this "Project" is two-fold: First, It is designed to prepare each of you with an advanced topic that you can comfortably explain in both a technical and informal setting (much like an interview). Second, the demonstrations will serve as a great review of topics that span the first 9 weeks of the class (and be a good refresher for some material that might have been covered in the very early weeks). The topic can be something that we have already covered in class, or something that we have not!

## Expectation

**You can frame the deliverable around one of the following scenarios**

- Potential employer asks "What is the most challenging thing you have learned... Great, explain it to me."
> *You may use a whiteboard for this scenario*
- Potential employer has assigned you a topic and asks you to come prepared to teach it at your next onsite interview to an audience of potential coworkers both in and outside of the department your applied for. 
> *You may prepare slides, example code, and/or use a whiteboard for this scenario*
- After graduation from DSI, you meet a new student of DSI at a happy hour. The new student says they will begin learning about [Your topic] next week, and you decide to give them a little exposure to the subject before hand. (You may discuss tactics you used to better help you understand the topic at hand).
> ~~*You may bring beer in for this scenario*~~
> *You may use a whiteboard for this scenario*

### Preparing this presentation will definitely require additional research!

Track down relevant blogs, tutorials, visuals, white papers, books, news articles, or instructors! The idea is to leverage every resource you can to fully understand the topic first, and then to develop a coherent way to communicate that topic.

## Deliverable

**Presentation**
- 8 - 10 minute presentation, with whiteboarding and/or slides that should take a technical audience from "0-to-60" regarding your topic.
- The presentation should contain a walkthrough example that helps support the topic being communicated.

#### _If you need a little inspiration as far as what content to talk about for each topic consider the following_
- _What are the benefits of using ...(your topic)?_
- _What are some of the challenges associated with ...(your  topic)?_  
- _What is one thing new that you learned about (your topic) you did not know before/was not covered in class?_
- _What is some of the developmental history of ...(your topic)?_
- _Why is (your topic) important in the broader field of data science as a whole?_

**Your topic should be cleared with your instructor by Wednesday, Sept 26th: 10am** </br>
**Your presentation is due Friday, Oct 5th: 10am**

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

For this project, students will be evaluated on a simple 4 point scale (0-3 inclusive). Instructors will use this rubric when scoring student performance on each of the core project requirements:

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | _Does not meet expectations. Try again._
**1** | _Approaching expectations. Getting there..._
**2** | _Meets expectations. Great job._
**3** | _Surpasses expectations. Brilliant!_

### Rubric

Your final assessment ("grade" if you will) will be calculated based on a topical rubric (see below).  For each category, you will receive a score of 0-3.  From the rubric you can see descriptions of each score and what is needed to attain those scores.

For Project 5 the evaluation categories are as follows:
- [Content](#content)
- [Example](#example)
- [Presentation](#presentation)

#### Content
- Back ground information is provided on the topic.
- Why and where is this topic is useful?
- Does your presentation discuss important details of the topic?
- Is the topic discussed to the appropriate depth.
- *Bonus* - You are capable of teaching me a concept I don't know anything about or teaching me something new about a topic I'm already familiar with.

#### Example
- Does your example show clearly the topic you're discussing?
- Did you acquire or generate data that is appropriate for the topic?
- Is value created by your topic clearly stated/shown?
- If important steps are left out or general assumptions made, are they clearly state as well as their potential impact?
- *Bonus* - Have two examples that are compared for similarities and/or differences.

#### Presentation
- Were you capable of explaining your topic without issue?
- Does your presentation material flow in a logical, linear order?
- Were there any bugs in your presentation/example?
- Is the level of technicality appropriate for the audience?
- Was your voice was clear, understandable and consistent?
- *Bonus* - Make a blog post about it!
